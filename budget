# GCP Cloud Hosting & Backup Cost Breakdown

## Hosting Setup
Looking at Google Compute Engine for hosting our apps. Here's what I'm thinking:

**VM Configuration:**
- n1-standard-2 instance (2 vCPU, 7.5 GB RAM)
- 100 GB disk space
- Should handle Nginx + Gunicorn + 4-5 Flask apps + MySQL/Postgres DB comfortably

**Cost:** Around $50-55/month for the base VM, but with OS image and some overhead, realistically looking at $70-80/month total.

## Backup Strategy
For daily backups, planning to use Google Cloud Storage:

**Backup Details:**
- Total backup size: ~855 GB (covering all user directories)
- Using rsync for daily sync to a bucket
- Only keeping the latest copy (no historical versions to save costs)
- Storage cost: $0.023/GB = ~$19.7/month
- Adding some buffer for growth and operations: $20-25/month

## Total Monthly Cost
- **Hosting (VM + DB):** $70-80/month
- **Backups (Cloud Storage):** $20-25/month
- **Total:** $90-105/month (â‚¹7,500-8,700/month)

## Notes
- All costs based on official GCP pricing
- Compute Engine bills per second, Storage bills per GB
- Since we're only keeping 1 daily backup copy (rsync overwrite), backup size stays constant at ~855 GB

## What This Covers
$90-105/month gets us:
- Hosting for 4-5 dynamic Flask applications
- Database running on the same VM
- Daily automated backups to Cloud Storage

## Good News
Google Cloud gives new users $300 in free credits! That means we can run this entire setup for about 3 months without any cost while we test everything out.
